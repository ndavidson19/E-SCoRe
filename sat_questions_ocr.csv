ID: 002dba45 Answer",[],"['.1764', '.1765', '3/17']","The correct answer is +. It's given that line 7 is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. This means that the slope of line 7 is
the negative reciprocal of the slope of line k. The equation of line k, y = -te + 5, is written in slope-intercept form

y = mz + b, where mis the slope of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line. It follows that the slope
of line kis — if. The negative reciprocal of a number is —1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of

—2 is —, or +. Thus, the slope of line 7 is +. Note that 3/17, .1764, .1765, and 0.176 are examples of ways to enter a

789975b7,"A gardener buys two kinds of fertilizer. Fertilizer A contains 60% filler materials by
weight and Fertilizer B contains 40% filler materials by weight. Together, the
fertilizers bought by the gardener contain a total of 240 pounds of filler materials.
Which equation models this relationship, where x is the number of pounds of
Fertilizer A and y is the number of pounds of Fertilizer B?","['A. 0.4x+0.6y =240', 'B. 0.6x+0.4y =240', 'C. 40x +60y =240', 'D. 60x +40y = 240\n\nID: 789975b7 Answer', 'B. Fertilizer A']",['B'],"Choice B is correct. Since Fertilizer A contains 60% filler materials by weight, it follows that x pounds of Fertilizer A consists
of 0.6x pounds of filler materials. Similarly, y pounds of Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials. When x pounds
of Fertilizer A and y pounds of Fertilizer B are combined, the result is 240 pounds of filler materials. Therefore, the total
amount, in pounds, of filler materials in a mixture of x pounds of Fertilizer A and y pounds of Fertilizer B can be expressed as

0.6x +0.4y = 240.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice transposes the percentages of filler materials for Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B. Fertilizer A
consists of 0.6x pounds of filler materials and Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials. Therefore, 0.6x +0.4y

is equal to 240, not 0.4x +0.6y. Choice C is incorrect. This choice transposes the percentages of filler materials for

Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B and incorrectly represents how to take the percentage of a value mathematically. Choice D is
incorrect. This choice incorrectly represents how to take the percentage of a value mathematically. Fertilizer A consists of
0.6x pounds of filler materials, not 60x pounds of filler materials, and Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials,
not 40y pounds of filler materials.",Easy
3008cfc3,"The table gives the coordinates of two points on a line in the xy-plane. The y-intercept of the line is (k — 5, b), where k and b
are constants. What is the value of b?

ID: 3008cfc3 Answer",[],['33'],"The correct answer is 33. It's given in the table that the coordinates of two points on a line in the xy-plane are (k, 13) and
(k + 7, —15). The y-intercept is another point on the line. The slope computed using any pair of points from the line will be
the same. The slope of a line, m, between any two points, (21, yi) and (22, yz), on the line can be calculated using the

slope formula, m = ee. It follows that the slope of the line with the given points from the table, (k, 13) and

(k+ 7, —15),ism = =. which is equivalent tom = = orm = —4. It's given that the y-intercept of the line is
(k — 5, b). Substituting —4 for m and the coordinates of the points (k — 5, b) and (k, 13) into the slope formula yields

—4= Ries’ which is equivalent to —4 = eee or —4 = Bo Multiplying both sides of this equation by 5 yields

—20 = 13 — b. Subtracting 13 from both sides of this equation yields —33 = —b. Dividing both sides of this equation by
—1 yields b = 33. Therefore, the value of bis 33.",Hard
f,"A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages.
For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total
weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum
number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?","['A. 2', 'B. 4', 'C. 5', 'D. 6']",['C'],"Choice C is correct. Let a equal the number of 120-pound packages, and let b equal the number of 100-pound packages. It’s
given that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: the inequality 120a@+100b < 1,100 represents

this situation. It’s also given that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages: the inequality @+ > 10 represents this

situation. Values of a and b that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and
100-pound packages the helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, a, in the helicopter, the
number of 100-pound packages, b, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing b in terms of a in the second
inequality yields ) > 10—@, so the minimum value of b is equal to 10 — a. Substituting 10 — q@ for b in the first inequality

results in 120a@+100(10—@) < 1,100. Using the distributive property to rewrite this inequality yields
120a+1,000—100a@ < 1,100, or 20a+1,000 < 1,100. Subtracting 1,000 from both sides of this inequality yields
20a < 100. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 20 results in @ < 5. This means that the maximum number of 120-pound

packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may result from incorrectly creating or solving the system of inequalities.",Medium
