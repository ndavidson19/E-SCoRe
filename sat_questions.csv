Hector used a tool called an auger to remove corn from a storage bin at a constant

the auger. After 5 hours of using the auger, 19,350 bushels of corn remained in the
bin. If the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, what is the total number of
hours Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in
the bin?","['A. \xa0\xa03', 'B. \xa0\xa07', 'C. \xa0\xa08', 'D. 12\nID: 2937ef4f Answer']",D,"Choice D is correct. After using the auger for 5 hours, Hector had removed 24,000 – 19,350 = 4,650 bushels of corn from the
storage bin. During the 5-hour period, the auger removed corn from the bin at a constant rate of 
 bushels per
hour. Assuming the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, after x hours it will have removed 930x bushels of corn.
Because the bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector started using the auger, the equation 24,000 – 930x = 12,840
can be used to ﬁnd the number of hours, x, Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the

Dividing both sides of this equation by 930 yields x = 12. Therefore, Hector will have been using the auger for 12 hours when
12,840 bushels of corn remain in the storage bin.
Choice A is incorrect. Three hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 3(930) = 21,210 bushels of corn remained,

A group of 202 people went on an overnight camping trip, taking 60 tents with

Assuming all the tents were ﬁlled to capacity and every person got to sleep in a

that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed

The x-intercept of the line with equation y = 120 – 25x can be found by substituting 0 for y and ﬁnding
the value of x. When y = 0, x = 4.8, so the x-intercept is at (4.8, 0). Since y represents the number of tons of cargo remaining

The average price per gallon on December 1, 2014\nID: af2ba762 Answer']",D,"Choice D is correct. Since 2.74 is a constant term, it represents an actual price of gas rather than a measure of change in gas
price. To determine what gas price it represents, ﬁnd x such that F(x) = 2.74, or 2.74 = 2.74 – 0.19(x – 3). Subtracting 2.74
from both sides gives 0 = –0.19(x – 3). Dividing both sides by –0.19 results in 0 = x – 3, or x = 3. Therefore, the average price
of gas is $2.74 per gallon 3 months after September 1, 2014, which is December 1, 2014.
Choice A is incorrect. Since 2.74 is a constant, not a multiple of x, it cannot represent a rate of change in price. Choice B is
incorrect. The difference in the average price from September 1, 2014, to December 1, 2014, is F(3) – F(0) = 2.74 – 0.19(3 –
3) – (2.74 – 0.19(0 – 3)) = 2.74 – (2.74 + 0.57) = –0.57, which is not 2.74. Choice C is incorrect. The average price per gallon
on September 1, 2014, is F(0) = 2.74 – 0.19(0 – 3) = 2.74 + 0.57 = 3.31, which is not 2.74.

Some values of the linear function f are shown in the table above.
Which of the following deﬁnes f ?","['A.', 'B.', 'C.', 'D. \nID: 12983c1e Answer']",C,"Choice C is correct. Because f is a linear function of x, the equation 
, where m and b are constants, can be
used to deﬁne the relationship between x and f (x). In this equation, m represents the increase in the value of f (x) for every
increase in the value of x by 1. From the table, it can be determined that the value of f (x) increases by 8 for every increase in
the value of x by 2. In other words, for the function f the value of m is

the values of x and f (x) from any row of the table and the value of m into the equation

A certain product costs a company $65 to make. The product is sold by a
salesperson who earns a commission that is equal to 20% of the sales price of the

minus the combined cost of making the product and the commission. If the sales
price of the product is $100, which of the following equations gives the number of
units, u, of the product the company sold to make a proﬁt of $6,840 ?","['A.', 'B.', 'C.', 'D. \nID: ae2287e2 Answer']",A,"Choice A is correct. The sales price of one unit of the product is given as $100. Because the salesperson is awarded a
commission equal to 20% of the sales price, the expression 100(1 – 0.2) gives the sales price of one unit after the
commission is deducted. It is also given that the proﬁt is equal to the sales price minus the combined cost of making the
product, or $65, and the commission: 100(1 – 0.2) – 65. Multiplying this expression by u gives the proﬁt of u units: (100(1 –
0.2) – 65)u. Finally, it is given that the proﬁt for u units is $6,840; therefore (100(1 – 0.2) – 65)u = $6,840.
Choice B is incorrect. In this equation, cost is subtracted before commission and the equation gives the commission, not
what the company retains after commission. Choice C is incorrect because the number of units is multiplied only by the cost
but not by the sale price. Choice D is incorrect because the value 0.2 shows the commission, not what the company retains
after commission.
